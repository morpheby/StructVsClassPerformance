# Struct vs Class Performance

This is a POC for the [response](https://medium.com/@MorpheBY/a-perfectly-fine-point-but-i-have-to-disagree-with-your-arguments-on-it-a7602ab1a3fb) to Gokhan Topcu's Medium article [Stop Using Structs!!](https://medium.com/commencis/stop-using-structs-e1be9a86376f).

It is designed to prove that "struct vs class" is a much more complex problem with regard to
performance.
